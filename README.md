# qASMint
Queued Assembler Interpreter (pronounced as `qas-mint`) is processor for simplified assembler designed for learning and optimizing less traditional algorithmic tasks.

Distinctive feature of the processor is availability of multiple stacks, queues, and tapes.

Number of available stacks, queues, tapes, their capacity and capacity of directly addressable memory can all be individually configured, which makes it well suitable for simulating traditional processors, turing machines, or very limited chips.

Every run of the processor will count number of register and memory accesses and instructuins executed. This makes it awesome tool for learning algorithmic complexity and for comparing different programs solving same tasks.
